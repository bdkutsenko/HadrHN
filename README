                	HadrHN test     

                  V. Ivanchenko, A. Bagulya, B. Kutsenko

The goal of this test is to identify accuracy of Geant4 elementary cross sections 
versus PDG collection of data and to control the hydrogen cross section from cross 
sections classes. These elementary cross sections are used to compute cross section 
off nuclei and are also used in hadronic models.

Projectile: proton, neutron, pi+, pi-, kaon+, kaon-, gamma
Elementary cross sections: “NS”, “PDG16”, “SAID”
Cross sections classes: “CHIPS”, “BGG”, “XS”
 
Data are from  http://pdg.lbl.gov.
Files with data are located in HadrHN/data directory. 

	        Compilation
G4BLOCAL points to directory where geant4-dev is located
HADSRC -> .../g4tests-verification/hadronic
G4BWORK points to directory where G4 executables are located (.../bin)
G4BBUILD points to build directory for geant4 (.../geant4-build-mt/)
G4VERSION ->  (10.5.0)

mkdir -p ${G4BLOCAL}/tests-build/HadrHN
cd ${G4BLOCAL}/tests-build/HadrHN
rm -f HadrHN

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${G4BLOCAL} \
      -DGeant4_DIR=${G4BBUILD}/lib64/Geant4-${G4VERSION} ${HADSRC}/HadrHN
make -j2

cd ${G4BWORK}
rm -f HadrHN
ln -s ${G4BLOCAL}/tests-build/HadrHN/HadrHN

cd ${HADSRC}/HadrHN

                Run Productuion

Simple run for proton, neutron:
$G4BWORK/HadrHN p NS [PDG16/SAID/BGG/CHIPS/XS] H
Simple run for pi+, pi-:
$G4BWORK/HadrHN pi+ NS [PDG16/SAID/BGG/CHIPS] H
Simple run for kaon:
$G4BWORK/HadrHN kaon+ kNS [VG/GG/CHIPS] H
  here VG - work only for K+-
       GG - for all kaons using VG
$G4BWORK/HadrHN alpha XS [ION] H

Simple run for gamma (different targets implemented):
$G4BWORK/HadrHN gamma IAEA [XS/ISOIAEA/ISOXS] H[Symbol of the element]

               Histogramms
ROOT files are creating automatically in HadrHN/test directory.

		Plots
python plotXS.py proton_proton_NS.root 0 # each ROOT file from HadrHN/test directory
python plotXS.py proton_proton_NS.root 1 # "1" only for p+p interaction to add cosmic data


Two models comparison, experimental points added if possible :
python plotXSmodel_only.py gamma_proton_CHIPS_1_0.root gamma_proton_IAEA_1_0.root 0 # Plot from 0 to 200 MeV in linear scale on x and logarithmic scale on y
python plotXSmodel_only.py gamma_proton_CHIPS_1_0.root gamma_proton_IAEA_1_0.root 1 # Plot from 0 to 100 000 MeV in double log scale
python plotXSmodel_only.py gamma_proton_CHIPS_1_0.root gamma_proton_IAEA_1_0.root 2 # Plot from 0 to 1.e+13 MeV in 10-based logarithmic scale on y
 
Plots are creating in HadrHN/plotXS directory.
